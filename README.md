<h1>Hi, I'm Jeremy! </h1>

Cyber is my passion. It has always been since I was younger. I enjoy lots of aspects 
in the tech world, from troubleshooting software and hardware, to checking for vulnerabilities within systems.
I love the countless skills the field has taught me and I'm looking forward to showcasing my skillset!
